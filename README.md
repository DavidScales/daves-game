# multiplayer-phaser-game

A very simple 2d multiplayer RPG. Created mostly for learning things like
* web sockets
* databases
* etc.

Inspired by Phaser.js examples like [Theodoric](https://github.com/tlmader/theodoric) and [Browser Quest](https://github.com/mozilla/).

Features
* (see TODO's)

### Things to do for real
* document with comments, at least non-obvious functions
* use WASD keys
* X auto click on canvas element onload --> actually don't do this. it hijacks the user control. There will be a loading page / start button anyways
* study the scoping / classes / that tricky JS stuff. WRITE IT OUT.
* abstract into modular files with build (also note build perf stats)
* loading screen
* sound effects, music
* multiplayer
* persistence / saving
* lobby
* buy assets - https://vryell.itch.io/tiny-adventure-pack
* PWA for perf (show stats)
* tests?

### Things I probably won't realistically get around to
* Look into tilemaps for more complex custom or procedural maps
* Dungeons?

### Small TODOs
* tint red on injury
